Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more?

Of order, how in safety best we may
Compose our present evils, with regard
Of what we are and where, dismissing quite
All thoughts of war.  Ye have what I advise."

The sound of blustering winds, which all night long
Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence</pre></div> </div>
