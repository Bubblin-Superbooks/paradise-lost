To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet,
On the bare outside of this world, that seem'd

Uncertain which, in ocean or in air.

Wherein past, present, future, he beholds,
Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake.

Transports our Adversary?  whom no bounds
Prescrib'd no bars of Hell, nor all the chains
Heap'd on him there, nor yet the main</pre></div> </div>
