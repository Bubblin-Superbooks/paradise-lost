The image of God in Man, created once
So goodly and erect, though faulty since,
To such unsightly sufferings be debased
Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man,
Retaining still divine similitude

And, for his Maker's image sake, exempt?

To serve ungoverned Appetite; and took
His image whom they served, a brutish vice,
Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.

Disfiguring not God's likeness, but their own;

While they pervert pure Nature's healthful rules
To loathsome sickness; worthily, since</pre></div> </div>
