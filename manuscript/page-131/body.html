The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warn'd
Their sinful state, and to appease betimes

My umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear,
Light after light, well us'd, they shall attain,
And to the end, persisting, safe arrive.

They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;
But hard be harden'd, blind be blinded more,
That they may stumble on, and deeper</pre></div> </div>
