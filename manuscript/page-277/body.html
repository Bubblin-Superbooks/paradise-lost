Forsaken of all good!  I see thy fall
Determined, and thy hapless crew involved
In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread
Both of thy crime and punishment:  Henceforth

Will not be now vouchsafed; other decrees
Against thee are gone forth without recall;

Is now an iron rod to bruise and break
Thy disobedience.  Well thou didst advise;
Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly
These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath

Distinguish not:  For soon expect to feel
His thunder on thy head, devouring fire.
