Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
Among his Angels, and his throne itself
Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire,
His own invented torments.  But perhaps

To us is adverse.  Who but felt of late,
When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear

With what compulsion and laborious flight
We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easy, then;

Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may</pre></div> </div>
