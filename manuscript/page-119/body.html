<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">adorned
Of living sapphire, once his native seat;
And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain,
This pendent World, in bigness as a star
Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.
Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge,
Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
