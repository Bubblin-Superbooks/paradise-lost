Grinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear
His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw
Destined to that good hour.  No less rejoiced
His mother bad, and thus bespake her sire:—

And by command of Heaven's all-powerful King,
I keep, by him forbidden to unlock
These adamantine gates; against all force

Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might.
But what owe I to his commands above,
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down
Into this gloom of Tartarus profound,
To sit in hateful office here confined,
Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born—
Here in perpetual agony and pain,
With terrors and with clamours compassed</pre></div> </div>
